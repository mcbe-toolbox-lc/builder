# @mcbe-toolbox-lc/builder

A build tool for transforming and copying Minecraft Bedrock add-on files. :hammer:

builder basically just "compiles" the source directory to the target you specify.
Most of what happens during this operation is simple file copying, but that's not enough for modern add-on development,
so it also has some useful extra features like JSON5 conversion and script compilation (bundling)! :eyes:
